Stoichiometric equations are mathematical expressions that describe the quantities and proportions of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. They are based on the principle of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. 

To write a stoichiometric equation, we need to know the chemical formulas of the reactants and products, and balance the equation so that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides. For example, the combustion of methane (CH4) with oxygen (O2) produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O):

CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O

This equation is balanced because there are 1 carbon atom, 4 hydrogen atoms, and 4 oxygen atoms on both sides.

To solve a stoichiometric equation, we need to use the mole concept, which is a way of measuring the amount of substance in chemistry. One mole of any substance is defined as the amount that contains 6.02 x 10^23 particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) of that substance. This number is called Avogadro's constant.

The mole concept allows us to convert between mass, moles, and number of particles using molar mass and Avogadro's constant. For example, the molar mass of methane is 16 g/mol, which means that one mole of methane has a mass of 16 g and contains 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of methane.

Using the mole concept, we can calculate the amount of reactants or products in a stoichiometric equation given the amount of another reactant or product. For example, if we want to know how much oxygen is needed to completely burn 10 g of methane, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert the mass of methane to moles using its molar mass: 10 g / 16 g/mol = 0.625 mol
2. Use the stoichiometric equation to find the mole ratio between methane and oxygen: CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O
3. Multiply the moles of methane by the mole ratio to find the moles of oxygen: 0.625 mol x 2 mol O2 / 1 mol CH4 = 1.25 mol O2
4. Convert the moles of oxygen to mass using its molar mass: 1.25 mol x 32 g/mol = 40 g

Therefore, we need 40 g of oxygen to completely burn 10 g of methane.

Stoichiometric equations are useful for predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions, such as how much product can be formed from a given amount of reactants, or how much reactant is needed to produce a desired amount of product. They are also important for understanding the relationships between different substances in chemistry, such as their composition, structure, and properties.
